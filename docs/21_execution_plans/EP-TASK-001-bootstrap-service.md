## Implementation Steps
Scaffold, complete factual content, validate, and commit.

## Parallel Execution
One workstream owns all documentation artifacts.

## Blockers
No adoption blocker is recorded.

## Test Plan

## Gate Commands
`python3 intent-preservation-system/scripts/validate_adoption_profile.py --root goalkeeper --phase planning`

## Documentation Updates
